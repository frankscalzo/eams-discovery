This technology also provides non-diagnostic functions such as data security and search options for patient and test records.

This product requires Microsoft SQL Server to provide a bidirectional interface to a healthcare facility`s electronic health record (EHR). In order to implement CardioPerfect, existing Microsoft SQL Server installations must have mixed-mode authentication enabled. Depending on the installation, a database named ccdb in an instance named CARDIOPERFECT will be created, which contains all information generated by CPWS. A second database called ccdb_audit is installed for maintaining an audit trail when enabled.

CPWS can be configured in the following ways:
